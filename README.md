# AishanTheLegend - 
## A telegram RPG bot!
***
## Us and our goal:
Hi, I am Ömer Kenan from the AishanTheLegend team and I am going to intrduce our first project!

We are trying to create a RPG much more easy to play than other RPG's on telegram/discord.

With a discussion in team, we decided to go with telegram on first step.

## Our goal is creating an easy to play RPG!

Our way to make the game more easy to play is adding buttons. Eventually, all the game will be playable from buttons! Of course if you want to type we will not stop you 😅 But at least there will be more easy choice.

Secondly, we want to solve mistyping problem. Because of that decided to go with no prefix. According to menu you in, without prefix you will be able to use the command. And of course there will be shortenings too.

And maybe in time, we could add an AI to figure out common mistyping problems then make the bot can even work with those mistypings. But I suppose for this, there is much more time.

## Our Revenue Model:
At first step, we didn't focus on income. But in time, we will need some money to rent servers, hire programmers to provide new features and maintenance. So eventually, we could be first AI based RPG in the world.

To earn money for now we have 2 options. First one is Patreon or Kickstarter. Second option is advertising. We didn't decided to go with one for now. Team is thinking about which path to chose right now. We will announce it later.
